# Search for a product and find alternatives

You can search for a product and click 'Find Canadian Alternatives' to get a list of products made or sourced from Canada.

Please note that we are currently only searching for food products through the main Open Food Facts database. There are databases for other types of products, and we have plans to expand this tool in the future.
