# From the Community

## Canadian Products, Canadian... Social Media?

Why stop at Canadian products? The fediverse is new form of social media change how we interact online. It is a network of independent social media platforms that can communicate with each other.

Similar to email or phone numbers, you can sign up with one service while still being able to interact with people elsewhere. It prevents one company or group from getting too much power, and you get a lot of choice on your online experience! If you would prefer a video explanation, [you can find one here](https://framatube.org/w/9dRFC6Ya11NCVeYKn8ZhiD).

[Fedecan](https://fedecan.ca) is a Canadian non-profit that is working on setting up more of these platforms. They run [lemmy.ca](https://lemmy.ca), one of the Canadian sections of reddit-like social media platforms. This is where we will eventually make a community, once we settle on a name for this project.
