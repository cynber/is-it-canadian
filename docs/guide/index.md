# About Us

We started this project to make it easier for people to find Canadian products. We are focussed on the following:

- **Open Source:** Since we are recommending products, transparency is very important. You can view and inspect all the [code on GitHub](https://github.com/cynber/is-it-canadian).
- **Fair Recommendations:** When you search for a product, we will list products from that category in a random order. You can further filter through the results to find what you want. We do not receive any compensation for recommending specific products, **nor will we ever.**
- **Supporting the community:** This project would not be possible without existing open source projects, communities, and resources. We will leave information about them throughout this site.

## Contribute

### Add product information

This project uses the [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) database to get product information. Open Food Facts is a non-profit project developed by thousands of volunteers from around the world.

You can contribute by adding products or updating information with their [mobile app](https://ca.openfoodfacts.org/open-food-facts-mobile-app)  on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openfoodfacts.scanner) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/open-food-facts-product-scan/id588797948). See other ways to contribute to Open Food Facts [on this page](https://ca.openfoodfacts.org/contribute).

### Write an article / blog post

You can see our [community section](community) for to see what we have so far. Searching for products alone can be tedious, so we are looking for people to write guides and compilations on specific categories.

For example, if you know a lot about Canadian ice cream, you can write a guide or a list of recommendations.
